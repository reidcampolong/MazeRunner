# Maze Race
### Background Information

I watched a really cool video on pathfinding robots once. I decided to make it into a game. Race against a pathfinding algorithm to the finish line! (Good luck with that..)

## Project Status
The pathfinding has been implemented.

Next, finishing implementing the final game client features.
TODO:
	1) Implement randomly generated maze terrain
	2) Implement round start/stop gameplay
 
## How to Play
1) Running the program will begin the game client. The client is written in Java utilizing the AWT library.

Player controls are the four arrow keys.
Pressing E will re-calculate the path shown in blue

## Running the Program
Built using Java 8.

## Future Plans
Definitely will be considering JavaFX. AWT was much quicker for me to get the project off the ground with. For now, I will be working on the TODO list visible under the ‘Project Status’ tab.
