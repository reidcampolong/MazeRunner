### Background Information

I watched a really cool video on pathfinding robots once. I decided to make it into a gui to visualize it.

## Project Status
The pathfinding has been implemented.
Place walls by clicking and run the algorithm using 'E'.
 
## How to Play
1) Running the program will begin the game client. The client is written in Java utilizing the AWT library.

Player controls are the four arrow keys.
Pressing E will re-calculate the path shown in blue
Place walls using the left mouse button

## Running the Program
Built using Java 8.

## What I Learned
This was my first time ever seeing the A* pathfinding algorithm. I thought it was really cool and set out to learn it on my own. I'm very proud of how it turned out, being a very fun project and helped me to turn a wikipedia page into a working algorithm.
